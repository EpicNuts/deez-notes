# Deez Notes

_Deez Notes_ is a demonstration web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed as a portfolio project to showcase my skills in **end-to-end testing** (Cypress & Playwright), **CI/CD automation**, and modern web application development.

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress and serves as a living example of my technical abilities.

---

## üöÄ Purpose

- **Portfolio:** This repository is primarily a showcase of my ability to build, test, and deploy a modern web application.
- **Testing:** Demonstrates comprehensive E2E testing using both [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
- **CI/CD:** Includes examples of automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Web Development:** Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

**[Deez-Notes!](https://deez-notes-omega.vercel.app/):** A note-taking web-app that harnesses **ChatGPT** to generate note-summaries and interact with your notes in new and exciting ways.
- Deployed with **Vercel**
- Authenticated by **Supabase** 
- Tested with **Cypress** and **Playwright** (Postman/Neumann coming soon!)
- CI/CD workflows with **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/EpicNuts/deez-notes/actions)**
- Modular, modern codebase (**TypeScript**, **Next.js** App Router)
- Responsive UI using **Tailwind CSS**
- Example API endpoints and database integration (**Prisma/Postgres**)

***Under active development ‚Äî new features and improvements coming soon!***

## üöÄ Deployment Overview

This project uses **Vercel** for production hosting and supports easy local development and deployment.

---

### üè† Local Development & Deployment

To run the app locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EpicNuts/deez-notes.git
   cd deez-notes
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (if available) and fill in required values (e.g., database connection, Supabase keys).
   - Make sure `.env.local` is **not** committed to git.

4. **Run database migrations and generate Prisma client:**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### üåç Production Deployment

- **Platform:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Production URL:** [https://deez-notes-omega.vercel.app/](https://deez-notes-omega.vercel.app/)
- **Branch:** The main branch is automatically deployed to production.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions run automated tests (Cypress, Playwright, linting, build) on every push or pull request. Only successful builds are deployed.

#### **How Production Deployments Work**
- Pushes to the `main` branch trigger a Vercel deployment.
- Vercel builds the app, runs migrations, and hosts the latest version.
- Environment variables for production are managed via the Vercel dashboard (never committed to git).

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Useful Scripts

- `npm run build`       Generates the Prisma Client and builds the Application
- `npm run migrate`     Ensures your Prisma Client is up to date and your local database schema matches your code, using the environment variables from [.env.local](/.env.local).
- `npm run lint`        Executes Next.js‚Äôs built-in ESLint integration to check for styling issues.

- `npm run dev`         Start the development server, which utilizes [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) for a faster refresh and hot reloading.
- `npm run start`       Start the production server

- `npm run playwright`  Run Playwright tests
- `npm run cypress`     Run Cypress tests in headless mode
- `npm run e2e`         Run Cypress and Playwright tests sequentially

---

### üìù Notes

- **Environment variables:** Store secrets and config in `.env.local` for local development and in Vercel‚Äôs dashboard for production.
- **Database:** Uses Prisma ORM with Postgres. Ensure your database is running and accessible for local development.
- **Authentication:** Uses Supabase; set up your Supabase project and keys as needed.

## üß™ Testing

This repo has a number of different test types targeting both a local development environment, and a fully deployed instance on Vercel. 

### UAT, Feature, E2E

#### Cypress

```bash
npm run cypress
```

#### Playwright

```bash
npm run playwright
```

#### E2E
Launch the Cypress and Playwright tests sequentially
```bash
npm run e2e
```

### Performance testing with K6

```bash
export $(cat .env.local | xargs)^C

k6 run -e LOAD_TEST_USERID=<load-test-userId> ./k6/loadtests/<load-test>.js
```
