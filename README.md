# Deez Notes

_Deez Notes_ is a demonstration web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed as a portfolio project to showcase my skills in **end-to-end testing** (Cypress & Playwright), **CI/CD automation**, and modern web application development.

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress and serves as a living example of my technical abilities.
